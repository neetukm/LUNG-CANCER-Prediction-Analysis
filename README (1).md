# 🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction Analysis

Predict the risk of lung cancer based on patient health indicators using a Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression).
This dashboard is built using **Streamlit** and offers prediction, visualization, and patient detail summaries.

> ⚠️ This is a **decision-support tool**, not a diagnostic device. Always consult a healthcare provider for medical evaluation.
